This deployment was possible using the demo.leo.app, I had initially tried the cli but fell into a serious bug which i had reported to the engineering team. so using the leo UI was seamless.

>>>>>>>STEPS>>>>>>>>>
I connected my wallet for the process to be possible
I navigated to the deploy option on the side bar, pasted my full program code & then inputted the fee amount about 12 credits , Submitted.
I clicked on my wallet after the confirmation message was completed & navigated to activities to get the status which at the point of clicking, i was referred to the explorer testnet website that generated my TX ID
